```

## ✨ Dependency libraries

- defi-wonderland/smock for mocking and faking 
- ngeohash for encode/decode lat and lon 
- hardhat-gas-reporter to get gas metrics when running tests : 
    - Under [hardhat.config.js](hardhat.config.js) remove the comment `//require("hardhat-gas-reporter"):`


## 📖 User Stories 
Every user story managed by the smart contract is covered by related tests. See [crazymap.js](/test/crazymap.js)

For running tests, use this command:
```
npx hardhat test .\test\crazymap.js
```

> **Caveat** : Mock/Fake library used works on hardhat network only.

## 🤖 Run the webapp locally using Test network (Sepolia)

> For the current version, smart contract addresses are set into App.js page. Check variables before running the frontend, in order to user the right smart contract addresses based on the chain (mainnet|sepolia).
```
//from app.js

// SET THE CRAZY MAP ADDRESS U WANT TO TEST
// mainnet or sepolia
const contractAddress = "";

// SET THE CRAZY FURY ADDRESS U WANT TO TEST 
// real (mainnet) or the testing one (sepolia)
const crazyFuryAddress = "";
```


Then run these commands
```
cd app 
npm restore
npm start
```

### 🧑‍🚀 **First Landing** 

On first use, UI will show you this message 

> Hey Bro, only CrazyFury members can use this service. Buy CrazyFury NFT to get access.

The reason is that Goerli doesn't have a  **REAL Crazy Fury Smart Contract** deployed, so we have to simulate the NFT ownership.

For doing that : 

1. **Create ```.env``` file in the project root and set environment variables as below**

    ``` 
    ALCHEMY_SEPOLIA_URL=YOUR_ALCHEMY_APP_URL
    SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY 
    ```
    > Create your app on [Alchemy](http://www.alchemy.com) if you don't already have one.

2. **Open the script**

    ``` scripts/demo/mint-fake-crazyfury-nft.js ```

3. **Set your wallet address** 

    ``` const myAddress = "SET YOUR ADDRESS BEFORE RUN"; ```

4. **Run the script:**  

    ```npx hardhat run .\scripts\Demo\mint-fake-crazyfury-nft.js  --network sepolia ```

### 🏠 **Add your home base**
A **Crazy Map member** is someone who have added his location and only **Crazy Map members** can see others members' locations on the map.

Let's add your location to see others members:

- double click on map where you are located now :)
- set your discord name.
- click Save.

### 🚎 **Update your home base**
Let's say you are a digital nomad and you change your home base frequently.

- double click on map where you are located now :)
- click Update.


## 🛎️ Caveats

Crazy Map smart contract has a dependency with Crazy Fury ERC721 smart contract, to check if the user ows the NFT (balanceOf).

For testing purpose a fake ERC721 called [MyFakeCrazyFuryNFT.sol](/contracts/MyFakeCrazyFuryNFT.sol) has been created in order to simulate the mainnet behaviour.
